# Progress (central status file)

- Codex continuation (2026-10-10): child emitter simulation matches all 17 controlled original snapshots and the native wheel renderer now traverses child lists; existing wheel resources contain no child records, and full child visual parity awaits a child-bearing native emitter. Sound now handles slides, ties, bend/pan and modulation; remote wall/charge/mini-turbo cues are positioned by the camera. Full core (258 passed, one ignored) and sound-filter (14 passed) runs passed before remote cue wiring; the latest game cargo build passes. Hardware playback parity remains open. Logs: `docs/CODEX_CHILD_PARTICLE_WORK_LOG.md`, `docs/CODEX_SOUND_WORK_LOG.md`.

One place to see where the port stands. Team memo: `docs/TEAM_MEMO.md`. Agents: start with `docs/AGENTS.md` and
`python tools/coord.py start <name>`; the live task board is `docs/TASKS.md`, the running log

## Lane A: course objects (Claude)

- Large Piranha audit (codex-audit): confirmed missing `0x1AA` behavior on
  Mario Circuit; its tick is `sub_20983C4`, separate from the existing small
  `0x1A6` plant. Added a scalar Rust translation and isolated capture/reducer.
  Replay matches 169 complete original calls (states 0/1, including RNG).
  Bite states 2..6 and native integration remain pending. See
  `CODEX_FIDELITY_AUDIT.md`.

- Crab presentation follow-up (codex-audit, 2026-10-10): restored the separate
  claw sprite; body/claw use original walk/idle clocks and independent actor
  materials. Natural clock/wait replay and 600 controlled original updates
  across all four states pass, including RNG; native close-up shows both parts.
  Full isolated core check:206 passed,0 failed,1 existing ignored; release build
  passes. Original draw callbacks were not captured; body wobble remains open.
  Harness: `tools/bizhawk/codex_crab_pattern/README.md`.
Ported from the game's code, replay-tested against BizHawk where possible (`vm_model/src/mapobj/`,
wired up in `game/src/objects.rs`):

## Lane B: characters, effects, Rainbow Road (Codex)
- Child-particle birth `sub_201C74C` now ported in `vm_model/src/nitro_particle_child.rs` (2026-10-10): all 40 controlled original births match every modeled field and RNG; all four rotation modes exercised. ROM-independent replay and overflow/zero-parent-life/record checks pass. Child pool/cadence/update/render/native integration remains open; see `tools/bizhawk/codex_particle_child/README.md`.
- Driver joint animations and face-pattern decoders are integrated; detailed drivers render with original clips. Details: `docs/CODEX_*` handoffs.
- Original ROM particle textures/simulation now replace cube drift sparks: smoke, blue flares, red sparks and A+B pivot smoke. Draw math matches 721 captured calls; rear contacts 645; smoke attachment 100; pivot gate 3993. Native charge rendering and active-effects race restart checked.
- CPU heading now matches 3500 original calls (Figure-8 and Rainbow Road, including inverted track), replacing floating atan2 with the SDK integer pipeline. Native seed1 Rainbow Road sweep: five falls before/six after; spiral falls remain unresolved.
- CPU wall-stall recovery is now wired: timer 7000 calls, correction 863 state1 probes, area selection 218 controlled callbacks. Previous-node/AREA targets feed the route cursor; final callback uses existing native respawn. Forced-stall run passed all four stages at 259/379/559/739 with immediate placement. Fixed-tick Rainbow Road sweep exited0 at 6000 ticks/2995 render frames with 10 falls; falls remain open. Respawn placement/spread and SDK reset yaw now match306 controlled original calls and are wired; steering resets on placement. Source-backed follow-up freezes every falling racer checkpoint and caches the respawn id at fall start. Supplied JGPT CPU route reset now matches 306 original callback probes across 37 nodes, including pacing reset; native wired. Fall/carry timing, absent-route/item-controller/full reset parity, other kart effects/child particles and GPU parity remain.
- Bowser terrain isolation (2026-10-10):96 controlled original queries at 16 logged native fall positions match Rust hit/no-hit, flags and push exactly (51 hits,45 misses). Original accepts the same lava contacts. Exact native swept queries and moving-block/CPU trajectory parity remain open. New replay and existing Rainbow backface regression both pass. Replay: `vm_model/tests/bowser_kcl.rs`.
- Actual Bowser terrain replay (2026-10-10):6 captured native swept queries (real center/previous/radius32768/facing) match original flags/push/hit exactly. Fresh shared release capture exited0 at 6000 ticks/frame 4431 with2 falls, away from the historical block region; concurrent edits prevent attributing improvement. Three targeted regressions pass. Source mapped original moving-terrain dispatcher/box/face/motion helpers; native object tops remain approximations. Next: paired moving-box contact probes.
- Moving-box terrain (Codex, 2026-10-10):new isolated `kart/moving_terrain.rs` matches30 controlled original Bowser box probes (tilted axes; face/edge/corner, floor/wall, hit/push/normal). Wired into the concurrently added `MovingSolid` box branch and `WithFloors`; retains original normals and moving-terrain flags0x40000000. SDK axes now match the real1-degree tilt. Cylinder geometry is now handled by claude-lane-a's separate replay-backed port. Full core suite passed before axes-only change; final box/adapter/axes replay passed. Final Windows release exited0 at6000 ticks/frame3776 with1 CPU6 fall outside the block region; no sliding-block falls in this check. Concurrent edits limit attribution.
- Moving-box center precision (2026-10-10): repeated all30 original probes with actual object positions and world centers recorded. Original SDK scale-add uses `position + up.scale(-half_height)`; subtracting the positive scale differs by one unit on tilted axes. Corrected native adapter; expanded world-coordinate replay passes. Final Windows release built; private native check exited0 at6000 ticks/frame1224 with1 CPU4 fall outside the block region and no sliding-block falls. Screenshot reviewed.
- BizHawk Lua fix (2026-10-10):invalid single-backslash escape in `autodrive_plan_triple.lua` corrected; all10 autodrive scripts parse with BizHawk's `lua54.dll`. Current `autodrive_plan.lua` was already valid. Broader scan found another invalid path escape in `mt_run.lua`; fixed it, and all79 local BizHawk Lua scripts now parse (compile-only).
- Earlier complete core check:171 passed,0 failed,1 existing CPU replay ignored; Windows release compiled and ran (fresh copy: `game/target/release/mkds_game_codex_cpu_respawn.exe`; supplied route reset native check passed at tick 900/frame 420). Detailed evidence/limitations: `analysis/CODEX_PARTICLE_MAP.md`, `docs/NEXT_GOALS.md`.

- Bowser's Castle falls (2026-10-10, Lane A): the cause was missing object floors (moving lava
  blocks 0xCA, rotating pipe 0xD1; reported by the user), not `respawn.rs`; now 2 falls / 6000
  ticks with every kart reaching lap 2. The earlier note blaming the respawn edits was wrong.
  Sliding-block falls remain open. After checkpoint freeze/id cache and supplied-route
  reset:8 falls/6001 ticks/frame 2655 (CPU3:2, CPU4:5, CPU7:1, player:0), all8
  resets used the JGPT route pointer successfully. No verified reduction in total falls. Valid original course32 recording:
  6000 frames,39,844 CPU driver calls,0 fall callbacks; racer IDs and moving CPU
  positions checked. Starts/settings/RNG differ; paired contact/trajectory comparison needed.

## Lane C: items and sound
See `docs/NEXT_GOALS.md` item 4 onward.

## Lane C session log (Claude)
- 2026-10-10 Bullet Bill speed: ramp was the lean decay, not an ease; removed the hack in `game/src/racers.rs`, replay test `vm_model/tests/bullet_speed.rs` passes, game builds. Notes: `docs/lane_c/PROGRESS.md`.
- 2026-10-10 Blue shell first 20 steering ticks: already exact (`replays_first_steering` passes); corrected stale notes in `docs/lane_c/PROGRESS.md`. No code change.
- 2026-10-10 Triple/trailing items belong to claude-lane-c (board T010); my recording attempt collided with another BizHawk run, no data written. T001 (Bowser's Castle object floors): consumer of flag 0x1000 found (`sub_1FFDEE4` -> `sub_20E1D10` -> box `sub_20E0BAC` / cylinder `sub_20E0764`), documented in `docs/function_notes.md`; exact cylinder port done (`vm_model/src/kart/moving_cylinder.rs`, 30-probe replay, 200 vm_model tests pass); box was ported by another agent. Still open: wire real object dims/attributes (+256/+260/+272/+276/+288) instead of the hard-coded constants in `game/src/objects.rs moving_floors`; platform motion (`sub_20E0680`). Task board: `python tools/coord.py list`.

- 2026-10-10 Regression sweep T017: `tools/native/sweep.ps1`; all 32 courses exit 0, 18 falls (Rainbow Road 13, five others 1, rest 0). Details in `docs/NEXT_GOALS.md`.

## Checks

- 2026-10-10 uncertainty audit and ROM builder (codex-audit): source-confirmed missing
  water path and crab state-driven texture clocks; older Boo-targeting / blue-shell notes
  are stale. Blue homing replay and full locked core suite pass (one existing ignored CPU
  replay). `tools/rom_builder.py` provides a stdlib TUI, ROM validation/provenance and
  locked release bundle using the user's external ROM. Ten Python tests pass; offline
  reference build and generated launcher smoke capture pass from another working
  directory. No fresh original emulator capture in this audit. Findings:
  `docs/CODEX_FIDELITY_AUDIT.md`; usage: `docs/CODEX_ROM_BUILD_WORKFLOW.md`.
- Baseline 2026-10-10: `vm_model` lib 130 passed / 0 failed / 1 ignored, all integration tests pass, `game` release builds. Working notes: `WORK_LOG.md`.
- `cargo test` in `vm_model` (object tests: `cargo test --lib mapobj`), `cargo build` in `game`.
- Falls sweep (autopilot): Airship 0-1 falls per race (from Bullet Bill blows), Delfino 0, Pinball 0,
  Cheep Cheep Beach 0, Peach Gardens 0, Mario Circuit 1, DK Pass 1.

- Codex input-ownership investigation (2026-10-10): same frozen precise-box binary produced1 fall/frame1224 and0 falls/frame5556 at6000 ticks with seed1; RNG draw totals already differ at tick300. Original position snapshots are sparse (104), insufficient for a matched CPU trajectory. Found Update keyboard/autoshot and FixedUpdate countdown writers targeting PlayerKart even while Cpu drives it; exclude Cpu from those writers. Keyboard ownership regression and private playable release passed. Twin native validation completed; see result below. No claim that this resolves all determinism issues. Public docs deployment d327b24 succeeded.

- CPU call order (Codex, 2026-10-10): completed read-only original capture364 calls/52 frames, always racer IDs1..7 ascending. Native drive_cpus now sorts by Racer.index before shared RNG consumption. Player0 takeover order remains uncaptured. Input-ownership regression and private playable release passed. Twin native validation completed; see result below. Prior empty-route test fixture corrected.

- CPU input/order validation (Codex, 2026-10-10): private release regression passed. Two same-executable/seed1 Bowser runs exited0 at6000 ticks (render frames5948/5939), zero falls each. All69 selected debug records match: progress/standings, RNG counts, item and recovery events; tick6000 has7698 draws each. Screenshot reviewed. This validates repeatability for these two runs, not complete state-every-tick determinism or original-game trajectory parity. Build: scratchpad/codex_bowser_build/release/mkds_game.exe. Completed original CPU-order capture364 calls and expanded original box replay30 probes remain the direct source/runtime evidence.

- Rainbow Road follow-up (Codex, 2026-10-10): same private input/order release exits0 at6000 ticks/frame5770 with19 falls (CPU7:7; player0,CPU1/2/5/6:2 each; CPU3/4:1 each), all flags0x84000800. One racer reached lap2; others remain lap1. Screenshot reviewed on spiral; spiral falls remain unresolved. Numeric positions: scratchpad/codex_rainbow_order_falls.json. Prior10-fall run used a different shared build; no isolated causal comparison or broad regression verdict.

- 2026-10-10 Codex Rainbow routing: all89 real swept fall-contact queries exactly match original hit/push/flags; ROM-backed replay passes. C identifies boost-ramp CPU guards, now ported through CpuKart.ramp: crossing-plane reach only during ramp flight, exact node target without wander/offset/RNG consumption. Two new regressions plus existing recovery pass; CPU heading still matches3500 original calls. Native end-to-end rerun pending; spiral falls not yet resolved.

- 2026-10-10 Codex particle validation: original child-emission guard now handles resources without SPA flag0x10000 using the primary-only pool path. New lifetime/list/RNG/polygon parity test and original child-particle replay pass. First Rainbow ramp-guard run exited101 before6000 capture because of this panic; discarded as a completed sweep. Private rebuild also exposed Piranha component visibility; three pub(crate) qualifiers unblock cross-module system ordering without behavior changes. Final native rerun remains pending.

- 2026-10-10 Codex final ramp/particle verification: corrected private Windows release built; completed seed1 native6000-tick runs exit0. Bowser:0 falls, render2219. Rainbow:18 falls, render2232 (CPU6:7, CPU1:4, CPU4:3, CPU5:2, CPU2/7:1; player0 and CPU3:0); player0 and CPU3 reach lap2. Both screenshots reviewed. Compared with prior frozen19-fall Rainbow run, shared source changed concurrently; no isolated causal improvement claim. Spiral falls remain open. Numeric results/positions: scratchpad/codex_ramp_guards_results.json. Source-backed ramp guards and optional-child fix retained; focused release regressions and3500 original heading replay pass. Next: capture cursor targets, body up/facing and motion at the first spiral divergence, rather than changing the already89-query-exact fall detector.
